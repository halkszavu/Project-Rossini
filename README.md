# Project-Rossini - A recipe repository

The application is for a repository of recipes. The recipes are grouped into dishes. Both the dishes and the recipes can be searched, they can be displayed and updated. With the required authentication a recipe or a dish can be deleted from the database.

## How to run the application?
There are multiple options:
 1. **Clone and compile**
    Clone the repository and compile it. The application is written in Java with Spring, and Maven will also be needed to build the eventual application.
 2. **Download the latest version**
    You can download the latest version from github. This can be run on any computer with Java runtime.
**NB:**
The database in 0.0.1 is in-memory database, meaning that any change to it will be lost when the application restarts.
